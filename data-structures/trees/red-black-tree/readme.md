A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains the following invariants:

Each node is either red or black.
The root node is always black.
All leaf nodes (NIL nodes) are black.
If a node is red, its children must be black.
For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
The idea behind these invariants is to ensure that the tree is always balanced, so that the worst-case time complexity of any operation on the tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

To maintain these invariants, a red-black tree uses a set of operations to insert, delete, and rebalance nodes in the tree. The specific details of these operations depend on the current state of the tree, but the basic idea is as follows:

Insertion: When a new node is inserted into the tree, it is initially colored red. If the parent of the new node is also red, the tree may become unbalanced with respect to the invariants listed above. To restore balance, the tree may need to be "rotated" (i.e., the parent of the new node is rotated left or right around the new node) and/or recolored (i.e., the colors of the nodes in the subtree rooted at the new node are changed).

Deletion: When a node is deleted from the tree, its child (if any) is moved up to take its place. If the deleted node was black, the tree may become unbalanced with respect to the invariants listed above. To restore balance, the tree may need to be "rotated" and/or recolored.

Rebalancing: If a subtree of the tree violates one or more of the invariants listed above, it may need to be rebalanced using the same rotation and recoloring operations used during insertion and deletion.

Overall, the key to understanding a red-black tree is to understand how it balances itself as nodes are inserted and deleted from the tree, while maintaining the invariants listed above. Once you have a good understanding of how this works, implementing a red-black tree in code is just a matter of translating the operations and algorithms into your chosen programming language.
